This is a set of scripts to generate a custom Linux ISO. I initially started out with https://github.com/ivandavidov/minimal-linux-script , but have rewritten most of it. I also copied (and revised) a few functions I wrote originally for https://github.com/OS-1337/OS1337 for downloading and extracting files.

Right now, the kernel fails on init, and this is very much a work in progress.
